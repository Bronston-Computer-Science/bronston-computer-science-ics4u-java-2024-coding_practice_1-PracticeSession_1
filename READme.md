# Follow these instructions

## Program Spec
- edit "Main.java"
- this practice will be more open-ended
- write a program that prompts the user to input some information (at least two different types of data)
  - for example take input for an int and take input for a double
- output that data using printf()

## Hints (Helpful Information)
